# git stuff
# mainly to remind me about git submodule commands
# that I do not know by heart
# (and think are kluget anyway)

# run `make git-post-clone' right after git clone of Ri5-stuff
# to update submodules (currently only Ri5-stuff.wiki)
git-post-clone:
	git submodule init
	git submodule update

# checking in generated docs
# a) to make visible on web/GitHub
# b) because toolchain fragile
# TBD: checking in redundant copies, in wiki and parent,
# mostly because belongs and should be versioned with wiki,
# but displays only in parent.

git-diff:
	git diff --submodule

# echo DEBUG: - I'm not really debugging
# I just want these messages colorized (in emacs)

# whereas my attempt at colorizing INFO:.* failed
